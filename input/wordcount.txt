MapReduce is a processing technique and a program model for distributed computing based on java
The MapReduce algorithm contains two important tasks namely Map and Reduce
Map takes a set of data and converts it into another set of data where individual elements are
broken down into tuples key value pairs Secondly reduce task which takes the output from a map
as an input and combines those data tuples into a smaller set of tuples As the sequence of the name
MapReduce implies the reduce task is always performed after the map job
